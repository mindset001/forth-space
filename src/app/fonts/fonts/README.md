# Place Your Custom Fonts Here

This directory is where you should place your custom font files when they're ready:

- `Andalus.woff2` - For general text and headings
- `ParagraphFont.woff2` - For paragraph text

After placing the files here, update the `src/app/fonts/fonts.ts` file to use these local fonts
instead of the temporary Google Fonts.
